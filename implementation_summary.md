# Quiz Application Improvements Implementation Summary

## 1. Fixed Results Page
- Added "Clear Results" button in the toolbar of results.html
- Implemented `/clear-results` endpoint in server.js to delete all results from the database
- Added confirmation dialog before clearing results to prevent accidental deletion
- Implemented proper error handling and success feedback for the clear operation

## 2. Fixed Delete Quiz Functionality in Admin Panel
- Identified the issue: Missing endpoint in server.js for `/delete-quiz/:id`
- Implemented the delete quiz endpoint in server.js with proper error handling
- The delete functionality now works correctly from the admin panel

## 3. Fixed AI Question Generation
- Updated AI generation prompt in server.js to use Unicode math symbols instead of LaTeX
- Added specific instructions to avoid LaTeX formatting in the AI prompt:
  - Use Unicode math symbols (×, ÷, ±, ≤, ≥, ≠, √, ∫, ∑, π, θ, ∞, etc.)
  - Use Unicode fraction symbols or simple notation (a/b)
  - Use superscript Unicode characters or simple notation (x^2)
  - Break complex equations into simpler parts using Unicode symbols
- Added better error handling for AI generation to provide clearer error messages

## 4. Made Server Error-Free
- Added comprehensive error handling for question generation
- Improved error handling for quiz entry with proper validation
- Implemented proper async/await error handling throughout the server code
- Added transaction support for critical operations like updating quizzes
- Added input validation across all endpoints to prevent invalid data
- Improved error responses to include more detailed information for debugging

## 5. Enhanced Proctoring
- Updated proctoring settings to be more strict:
  - Lowered the threshold for multi-face detection from 45 to 20 frames
  - Added no-face detection with a threshold of 30 frames
  - Added eye movement detection to prevent looking away from screen
- Added additional proctoring checks:
  - Browser focus monitoring to detect when the exam window loses focus
  - Prevention of keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+P, Alt+Tab, etc.)
  - Right-click prevention to block context menu
  - Auto-attempt to return to fullscreen after exiting
- All proctoring violations trigger warnings that count toward the maximum allowed

## Testing
- All implemented features have been tested and are working as expected
- The application now provides a more secure and robust exam environment
- Error handling has been improved to make the application more stable
